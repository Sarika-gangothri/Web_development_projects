**Simple To-Do List Web App**

This folder contains a basic To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Features:**

1] Add new tasks by entering them in the input field and pressing Enter.

2] Remove tasks by clicking the trash can icon next to each item.

3] Mark tasks as completed by clicking on the list item itself.

4] Visually appealing design with a fun font and color scheme.

**Technologies Used:**

--> HTML: Provides the structure of the webpage and to-do list elements.

--> CSS: Styles the application layout, fonts, colors, and visual elements.

--> JavaScript (jQuery): Manages user interactions with the to-do list, including adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed.

_Feel free to explore and modify the code to personalize your To-Do List experience!_

Note : I've used the Font Awesome library which Provides icon fonts for the trash can symbol used in the task removal functionality.
