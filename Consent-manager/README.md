# Consent Manager UI

A beginner-friendly web interface prototype that allows users to view, grant, and revoke data sharing permissions across applications. This project was inspired by the IUDX (India Urban Data Exchange) platform and created as part of my learning journey into web development and UI/UX design.

## ✨ Features

- 📋 Dashboard to view current data sharing permissions
- 🔄 Toggle controls to simulate "Allowed" and "Revoked" states
- 🔐 Manage Permissions page with individual controls for each application
- 📱 Responsive and clean UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- 🔗 Inspired by real-world consent management workflows

## 📂 Pages

- `index.html` – Displays the dashboard view of current permissions
- `manage.html` – Allows users to manage and update permissions

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript
- Figma (for wireframe design)

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to demonstrate my interest in UI/UX design and front-end web development. It serves as a foundational step toward building complex, responsive, and user-focused interfaces.

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Migrate to React.js for dynamic rendering
- Add localStorage or backend support for saving user preferences
- Integrate animations and transitions
- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
